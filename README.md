# Simple Landing Page

### My first React Project

The goal is to get more practice with JSX and the Component tree.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**

## Initial Set up

After making sure Node.js is installed, I install [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) which I find it amazing that 1 command helps me set up my web app!

To test that it's working, I run the `npm start` command to run the app in the development mode. I could see that the app started in localhost:3000 and it looks like it is running properly and that webpack compiled successfully.

I reset the App.js file to a blank slate to work on it as well as removed any default files such as the following: logo.svg, reportWebVitals.js, setupTests.js, App.test.js, and their imports to keep only the minimum needed files.

I wanted this simple landing page to have 3 sections and with that I created 3 components for those sections:

-HeroSection.js
-ServicesSection.js
-FooterSection.js

## Exporting and Importing

I wanted HeroSection.js, SercicesSection.js, and FooterSection to be in the same level of the component tree but one level deep inside App.js.

To accomplish that, I `export default` each component, and then `import` them in App.js.

**Obstacle** I wanted to write this note to myself because I was taking some time to figure out why my code wasn't working this point.

When `export default FooterSection();` remember that you do not need to call the function; removing `()` made it work!. Also, you have to `return()` some JSX in each component or an error will occur.

## Hero Section

One thing I had to get used to is that React uses `className` over class attribute.

The Hero section consist of a nav with display: flex, a background image where I had to Google to learn how to dim the background image using `linear-gradent` value, and a hero title that is centered.

## Services Section

### Using map() function in React

Something new I learnt is that I could put the variable's date in objects and .map() through them.

`const SERVICE_ BLOCK_DATA = [` I learnt that we use the CONSTANT syntax when not getting from a server but when it's in our code.

The SERVICE_BLOCK_DATA array will have objects with 2 properties, imgURL source and title,

```
const SERVICE_BLOCK_DATA = [
  {
    imgURL: 'https://assets.codepen.io/6060109/agency-service-1.png',
    title: 'Web Design',
  },
  {
    imgURL: 'https://assets.codepen.io/6060109/agency-service-2.png',
    title: 'ecommerce',
  },
  {
    imgURL: 'https://assets.codepen.io/6060109/agency-service-3.png',
    title: 'automation',
  },
];
```

In my JSX, I could write JS code inside `{}` and use the map function `SERVICE_BLOCK_DATA.map()` and return JSX.

```<img src={block.imgURL}></img>
              <p>{block.title}</p>
```

Now, for each item in the object array, we create a JSX block that replaces the `<img src>` and `<p>` variables.

```
 <div class='services-section'>
      <h2>Our Services</h2>
      <div className='services-container'>
        {SERVICE_BLOCK_DATA.map((block) => {
          return (
            <div className='service-block'>
              <img src={block.imgURL}></img>
              <p>{block.title}</p>
            </div>
          );
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
```
